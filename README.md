## What it is

A React-free port and code-generation pipeline for using the
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) design system and component API with
[Hono JSX](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/jsx) and [HonoX](https://github.com/honojs/honox).

Components are generated from the upstream shadcn/ui (Base UI variant) registry
and translated into plain `hono/jsx` function components. You install their
source into your project with the shadcn CLI, just like shadcn/ui.

## What it is not

Not React running on Hono. There is no React, React DOM, `@hono/react-renderer`,
Base UI, or Radix runtime in the generated components.

## Main benefits

- React-free, native `hono/jsx` components (SSR-first)
- Works with plain Hono and HonoX
- Tailwind CSS v4 and the shadcn/ui design tokens
- Source-code ownership via a shadcn-compatible registry
- Regenerated from upstream shadcn/ui instead of hand-maintained forks
- JavaScript only where interactive behavior requires it (none for the current set)
